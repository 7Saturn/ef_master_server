# EF Master Server

## Summary
This repo provides a master server for the game Star Trek: Voyager Elite Force. It is written in C# and should be easily buildable on MacOS, Linux, FreeBSD and Windows and the resulting exe file can be used afterwards on all of these systems.

## Additional Information
For further details, see *readme.html* inside the repo. (It is intended to be shipped along with the build package and be viewed in a web browser.) I really don't believe in Mark Down to be used for this kind of work...
